# qtsimplecrypto
Simple to use encryption library for Qt/C++. Uses openssl directly.
Main use case is to do authenticated RSA+AES encryption using OpenSSL EVP.
Not audited by cryptography experts, I do not guarantee it is actually secure.

Code is not used by anyone in production.
Use at your own risk.
